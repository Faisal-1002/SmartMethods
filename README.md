# Task 1

In this task, I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL to develop a webpage to control an arm robot. HTML was used for the page coordinate like adding range sliders and their values and adding two buttons, then I used CSS to design the HTML page. Next, I used JS to add a counter that shows the value of each range slider. Moreover, I used PHP to connect to my database and sending queries to it and I used it to create another page that shows the data in the database. The database is created using MySQL and it has 6 columns for the 6 range sliders.

# Task 2

This task is similar to task 1 but here it is for the base of the arm bot, I changed the webpage design to make it like remote control, then I changed the database to 5 columns for the new remote control design.

# Task 3

In this task I used IBM Watson to creat a chatbox. Then I implment it to my php page which is in the previous task. This chatbox is working as a help center where users can use it for asking help.

# Task 4

In this taks I used Python and IBM Watson to convert speech-to-text. Then I export the text to txt file and the audio to mp3 file.
